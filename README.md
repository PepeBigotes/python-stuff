## List of contents:
  - <b>`python-fetch`</b> : Legacy/one-script version of my [pepefetch](https://github.com/PepeBigotes/pepefetch) project  
    >My first ever script in python btw.  
  - <b>`modmenu-template`</b> : A simple modmenu UI powered in pygame  
    >I started this in a impulsive manner and I don't really plan to do anything with it in the near future.
  - <b>`decimal_2_binary`</b> : Converts a decimal number to binary  
    >Our teacher was explaining how to convert decimal numbers to binary, I got bored and decided to make a script to do it for me instead.
  - <b>`randomness-test`</b> : A script to test the pseudorandomness of the 'random' module  
    >Decided to leave it here because the results are interesting
  - <b>`binary-junk`</b> : Prints random binary numbers  
    >Once again I coded something useless instead of paying attention in class.
  - <b>`hex-junk`</b> : Prints random hexadecimal numbers  
    >Evolution of the <b>binary-junk</b> script.
  - <b>`net-slow`</b> : Attempts to slow the network with excessive traffic  
  ***Beware that you can NOT stop this script once you start it!***  
    >Can also be used as a DoS or DDoS tool. Created for educational purposes only.
  - <b>`ping-sweep`</b> : Detects active hosts in the network by using pings  
    >At the moment it only scans for the 255.255.255.0 subnet mask.

    >I also made this one while not listening in class.
  - <b>`byte-converter`</b> : Converts MiB to MB, GB to GiB, and so on.  
    >Why are we doing this manually in our IT class anyways?
