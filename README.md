<h3>A simple repository where I keep my python stuff</h3align=>
</div>

## List of contents:
  - <b>`python-fetch.py`</b> : Legacy/one-script version of my [pepefetch](https://github.com/PepeBigotes/pepefetch) project. My first ever script in python btw.  
  - <b>`modmenu-template`</b> : A simple modmenu UI powered in pygame.  
  I started this in a impulsive manner and I don't really plan to do anything with it in the near future.
  - <b>`decimal_2_binary`</b> : Converts a decimal number to binary  
  Our teacher was explaining how to convert decimal numbers to binary,  
  I got bored and decided to make a script to do it for me instead.
  - <b>`randomness-test`</b> : A script to test the pseudorandomness of the 'random' module.  
  Decided to leave it here because the results are interesting
