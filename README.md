<h1><b>Python Stuff</b></h1>
<h3>A simple repository where I keep my python stuff</h3align=>
</div>

## List of contents:
  - <b>`python-fetch.py`</b> : Legacy/one-script version of my [pepefetch](https://github.com/PepeBigotes/pepefetch) project. My first ever script in python btw.  
  - <b>`modmenu-template`</b> : A simple modmenu UI powered in pygame.  
  I started this in a impulsive manner and I don't really plan to do anything with it in the near future.
