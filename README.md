<h1><b>Python Stuff</b></h1>
<h3>A simple repository where I keep my python stuff</h3align=>
</div>

## List of contents:
  - <b>`python-fetch.py`</b> : My attempt to replicate the <a href="https://github.com/dylanaraps/neofetch">neofetch</a> tool in python.  
 The goal is to keep it simple, easy to customize and cool.  
  - <b>`modmenu-template`</b> : A simple modmenu powered in pygame.  
  It's WIP at the moment, I will make a functional modmenu whenever I get to it.
